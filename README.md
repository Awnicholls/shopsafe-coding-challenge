## ShopSafe Coding Challenge 
A simple form that lets you choose a car to rent, followed by a thank you page detailing the information that was submitted.

The form itself is styled with Material Ui in order to make it easier to crete something that looks good in the alloted time. I was going to add form validation using yup and react-hook-form for all parts, however it seemed like it would add too much to be done in the time so form validation is only fully implemented for the text fields.

What I would hope to add is various checks for the date picker, not allowing the end date to be before the start, as well as conditional rendering of fields that rely on inputs. Currently the text at the bottom of the form will always say days even if it is one day and will show negative values.
